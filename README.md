# 项目理念

知识作为人类文明的结晶，本应以其无界性为特质，成为全人类共享的公共财富。然而，当前以知识产权为核心的制度安排，却在一定程度上将知识的无界性裹挟于资本利益之中，限制了知识的自由传播与共享。通过重新审视知识的归宿、生产者的劳动价值以及社会技术的可能性，我们可以探索一条通向知识公有化的全新道路。本文基于POIP（Public Ownership of IP，知识产权公有化）这一理念，探讨如何通过技术与制度创新，实现知识的真正公共化。

#### 知识的本质与归宿：超越资本逻辑

知识的本质在于其无界性。它并不像物质商品，使用时会被消耗，反而是一种可以通过传播而不断放大的公共资源。历史上，许多伟大的思想、技术和文化成就，都是通过自由传播焕发出巨大的社会价值。然而，当知识被资本逻辑所裹挟，其无界性便被削弱，甚至转变为一种被垄断的资源。知识的归宿不应是资本，而是公众领域。这不仅是对知识自身特性的尊重，同时也符合社会公平的基本原则。

在当前知识产权制度下，知识往往被产权化，成为资本攫取垄断地租的工具。一家出版公司、一家专利持有公司，常常通过知识产权的垄断性，收取超出知识生产者本身劳动价值的巨额利润。而真正参与知识生产的劳动者——作者、科学家、艺术家，却未必能从中获得与其劳动价值相称的报酬。这种制度安排，事实上背离了知识应当服务于全社会的初衷，进一步加剧了知识生产和传播的不平等。

#### 知识生产者的报酬与制度的重塑

批判现有制度的同时，我们也必须正视一个现实：知识生产者的劳动需要被充分尊重和回报。知识的生产，是一项需要创造力、时间和精力的劳动，其价值不容忽视。因此，任何试图重新定义知识传播和所有权的尝试，都必须确保生产者能够获得与其劳动投入相称的报酬。

然而，这种报酬并不必然通过知识产权的垄断性租金来实现。依靠新技术的创新，我们可以做到让知识生产者获得合理的收益，同时保证知识传播的公平性。区块链技术的出现，为知识的公平分配提供了技术支持。通过区块链，我们可以实现一种全新的知识传播和支付模式：当读者购买某一知识产品时，其消费金额可以公平地分配给作者和其他读者。也就是说，作者在获得足够报酬后，知识的传播成本可以逐步分摊到所有消费者身上，最终实现知识的共享化和低成本化。

#### 尊重作者与读者的愿景

对知识的所有权和传播方式的重新思考，不仅关乎生产者的利益，也关乎每一位知识消费者的愿景。珍视自己作品的作者，真正的愿望应当是让作品被卖给全世界，而非局限于特定的资本家或平台。作品只有被更多人阅读、欣赏，才能实现其最大的社会价值。而作为读者，我们也应当希望自己为作品支付的金钱，能够推动知识向公共化迈进一步，而非仅仅成为平台或者资本的垄断收益。

当前，许多知识产品的售价，很大一部分来自于平台或者资本的抽成，而非直接支付给作者。这不仅让读者的消费意愿受到抑制，也让知识的传播受到限制。如果我们能够通过新的技术和制度安排，减少甚至消除这种资本的中间环节，无论是作者还是读者，都会成为最终的受益者。

#### POIP：知识公有化的温和尝试

在这一背景下，POIP理念的提出，为知识的公共化提供了一个温和且可操作的路径。一方面，POIP允许作者通过设定一个不可能达成的goalcount，继续维持现有的商业模式；另一方面，POIP让作者可以根据自己的劳动时间决定自己的酬劳上限，设定一个合理的goalcount，在销售达到goalcount后，接下来继续销售产生的利润将平均分配给所有购买者，直到达到maxcount后，知识产权就自动公有化。这一设计尊重了作者的选择权，同时为知识的最终公共化提供了可能。

更重要的是，POIP并非仅仅是一种商业模式的调整，它还承载着更深远的社会意义。它试图引导一种新的观念：不仅知识的最终归宿应当是公有化，“利润”的最终归宿也应当是公有化。在这一体系下，通过集体的努力，知识的价值可以被更多人共享，而非被少数资本力量所垄断。

#### POIP的激进意义与未来探索

POIP的尝试，其实指向了一个更为激进的理念：重新思考在共产主义社会中的知识组织模式。不仅知识应该被公有化，“利润”也应当是公有化的，而这恰恰动摇了资本主义体制的存在基础。只有实现利润的公有化，剥削才能被真正意义地剔除，社会才能真正意义地走向共产主义的组织模式。POIP仅仅是我在这个方向上努力的第一步，道阻且长！

#### 知识产权公有化合约-POIP

POIP基于区块链技术，其核心为一个智能合约，它的名称叫做“买断补偿公有化合约”。这个合约由浅入深经过了两次迭代，通过了解合约的迭代过程，可以非常清晰地理解POIP合约的具体原理。如下：

##### 买断封顶合约（有限买断合约）

知识生产者最初私有知识产权。其为自己设定一个酬劳上限Max，为产品使用权设定一个单价Price，由此可算出需要卖出的数目Count = Max / Price。接着知识生产者在市场中售卖知识产品的使用权，随着售卖的进行，实际售出数目渐渐逼近Count。当实际售出数目达到Count后，知识生产者放弃私有的知识产权，将知识产品的产权公有化，此后所有人可以自由地使用该知识产品。

买断封顶合约是非常简单容易实现的合约，但知识产权的公有化可能会导致购买者的不满，进而大家都倾向于等待知识产品被公有化后无偿地使用，而不愿意在最开始花钱购买知识产品的使用权。为了弥补这一点可能采取的措施：1. 为购买者颁发荣誉 2. 强调购买者先买在时间上的优势，在实际售出数目达到Count之后，并不立即释放知识产权，而是等一段较长的时间再释放知识产权 3. 使用下述买断补偿合约

##### 买断补偿合约

知识生产者最初私有知识产权。其为自己设定一个酬劳上限Max，为产品使用权设定一个单价Price，由此可计算处需要卖出的数目Count = Max / Price。接着知识生产者在市场中售卖知识产品的使用权，随着售卖的进行，实际售出数目渐渐逼近Count。当实际售出数目达到Count后，知识生产者并不释放私有的知识产权，但接下来假设有更多人购买该知识产品，他们所花的费用将均匀地补偿给所有购买者（也包括当时的购买者自身），于是久而久之，购买该知识产权使用权的实际花费将越来越便宜，直至近乎免费，而之前的购买者也被同等地补偿，最终在所有购买者都公平地付费的情况下，实现了知识产品使用权的近无价化，进而形成实质上的知识产权公有化。

关于”将费用均匀地补偿给所有购买者“的具体实现方式。合约维护一个账本，其内容包括：

1. 合约的账户余额（不同于知识生产者的账户，合约的账户余额用于保存溢出的金额，以实现补偿购买者，知识生产者无权从中提取金钱）

2. 购买者名单、购买者人数

3. 每一个购买者已提现的金额

4. 酬劳上限、产品单价

   在新的购买者购买知识产品的使用权时，首先将他计入购买者名单中，此时购买者人数自然加一，接着将购买者所花的钱转账到合约的账户余额中。

   在一个已购买者想要提现补偿金额时，首先查看他已经提现的金额，然后计算当前时间节点下每个已购买者应得的补偿金额，可以用下列公式计算：


$$
Amount = \frac{[(BuyerCount \times Price) - Max]}{BuyerCount} = Price - \frac{Max}{BuyerCount}
$$
接着用应得补偿金额减去已提现的金额，就可以计算出此次他应提现的金额。体现完成后，再将已提现金额更新为当前的

应得补偿金额即可。

基于上述逻辑，可以进一步降低购买的门槛，即将购买与立即提现补偿金额结合起来，购买者只需支付单价-当前应得补偿金额即可购买到使用权，但是在购买完成后立即将购买者的已提现金额设置为当前的应得补偿金额。

买断补偿合约仍有一个缺点，即知识产品的所有权在形式上仍然是私有的，只是其使用权会随着购买人数的增多逐渐趋于免费。如果要进一步推动知识产品的公有化，可以采用下述买断补偿公有化合约。

##### 买断补偿公有化合约

知识生产者最初私有知识产权。其为自己设定一个酬劳上限Max，为产品使用权设定一个单价Price，由此可计算处需要卖出的数目Count = Max / Price。此外，知识生产者规定一个补偿金上限MaxCompensation，这个补偿金上限不会超过Price，但理想状态应当接近Price。接着知识生产者在市场中售卖知识产品的使用权，随着售卖的进行，实际售出数目渐渐逼近Count。当实际售出数目达到Count后，知识生产者并不释放私有的知识产权，但接下来假设有更多人购买该知识产品，他们所花的费用将均匀地补偿给所有购买者（也包括当时的购买者自身），于是久而久之，购买该知识产权使用权的实际花费将越来越便宜，与此同时，每一个已购买者的补偿金也越来越接近补偿金上限。当当前每个购买者的应得补偿金达到补偿金上限后，知识生产者放弃私有的知识产权，而将知识产品的产权公有化。

关于如何识别”当前每个购买者的应得补偿金达到补偿金上限“。应得补偿金与购买者总人数密切相关，因此实际上我们只需要持续对购买者总人数进行计数，当购买者总人数达到一定数量后，补偿金自然达到上限。具体而言，购买者总人数上限可以用如下公式计算：


$$
MaxBuyerCount\times Price - Max = MaxBuyerCount\times MaxCompensation \\
MaxBuyerCount = \frac{Max}{Price - MaxCompensation}
$$



# Project Concepts

Knowledge, as the crystallization of human civilization, should naturally possess the characteristic of being boundless, serving as a shared public wealth for all humanity. However, under the current system centered on intellectual property (IP) rights, the boundless nature of knowledge has, to some extent, been subsumed into the interests of capital, restricting its free dissemination and sharing. By reexamining the true destination of knowledge, the labor value of its producers, and the possibilities offered by social technologies, we can explore a new path toward the public ownership of knowledge. This article, based on the concept of POIP (Public Ownership of IP), seeks to explore how technological and institutional innovation can achieve the genuine publicization of knowledge.

#### The Nature and Destination of Knowledge: Beyond the Logic of Capital

The essence of knowledge lies in its boundlessness. Unlike tangible goods that are consumed when used, knowledge can be amplified and expanded through dissemination, functioning as a public resource. Throughout history, many great ideas, technologies, and cultural achievements have generated tremendous social value through free dissemination. However, when knowledge becomes entangled within the logic of capital, its boundless nature is curtailed, even turning into a monopolized resource. The rightful destination of knowledge should not be capital but the public domain. This aligns not only with the intrinsic characteristics of knowledge but also with the basic principles of social equity.

Under the current intellectual property regime, knowledge often becomes privatized, serving as a tool for capital to extract monopoly rents. Publishing companies and patent-holding entities frequently use the monopolistic nature of intellectual property to extract profits far exceeding the labor value inherent in the production of knowledge. Meanwhile, the true laborers of knowledge production—authors, scientists, and artists—may not receive rewards commensurate with their labor value. This institutional framework not only deviates from the principle that knowledge should serve society as a whole but also exacerbates inequalities in knowledge production and dissemination.

#### Compensation for Knowledge Producers and Institutional Restructuring

While critiquing the current system, we must also confront a reality: the labor of knowledge producers must be fully respected and compensated. The production of knowledge is an endeavor requiring creativity, time, and effort, and its value must not be overlooked. Therefore, any attempt to redefine the ownership and dissemination of knowledge must ensure that producers receive rewards proportional to their labor input.

However, such compensation does not necessarily need to rely on monopoly rents derived from intellectual property rights. With innovations in technology, it is possible to ensure that knowledge producers receive fair returns while maintaining the fairness of knowledge dissemination. Blockchain technology, for instance, presents a technical avenue for the equitable distribution of knowledge. Through blockchain, we can implement a novel model for knowledge dissemination and payment: when users purchase a knowledge product, the payment can be equitably distributed among the creator and other consumers. In this way, once creators receive adequate compensation, the cost of knowledge dissemination can be gradually shared among all consumers, ultimately achieving the goals of shared and low-cost access to knowledge.

#### Respecting the Aspirations of Authors and Readers

Rethinking the ownership and dissemination of knowledge concerns not only the interests of producers but also the aspirations of every knowledge consumer. Authors who cherish their works would ideally want their creations to reach a global audience rather than being confined to specific capitalists or platforms. Only when works are read and appreciated by more people can they achieve their greatest social value. Similarly, as readers, we would hope that the money we spend on acquiring knowledge contributes to the publicization of knowledge rather than merely becoming a source of monopolized profit for platforms or capital.

Currently, a significant portion of the price of many knowledge products consists of platform or capital extraction, rather than direct payment to the author. This not only discourages readers from consuming knowledge but also restricts its dissemination. If we can reduce or even eliminate such capital-driven intermediaries through new technological and institutional arrangements, both authors and readers will ultimately benefit.

#### POIP: A Moderate Attempt at Knowledge Publicization

Against this backdrop, the concept of POIP offers a moderate and feasible pathway toward the publicization of knowledge. On one hand, POIP allows authors to maintain the current commercial model by setting an unattainable goal count. On the other hand, it enables authors to determine their own upper limit of remuneration based on their labor input by setting a reasonable goal count. Once this goal count is reached, the subsequent profits generated through continued sales are distributed equally among all purchasers. After a maximum count is reached, the intellectual property automatically enters the public domain. This design respects the autonomy of authors while also paving the way for the eventual publicization of knowledge.

More importantly, POIP is not merely an adjustment to a commercial model; it carries deeper societal implications. It seeks to foster a new perspective: not only should the ultimate destination of knowledge be publicization, but the ultimate destination of "profits" should also be publicization. Within this system, through collective effort, the value of knowledge can be shared by more individuals, rather than being monopolized by a few powerful capital entities.

#### The Radical Implications of POIP and Future Exploration

The attempt to implement POIP ultimately points toward a more radical notion: rethinking the organizational models within a communist society. Not only should knowledge be publicized, but "profits" should also become public property, challenging the very foundation of the capitalist system. Only by achieving the publicization of profits can exploitation be truly eradicated, paving the way for society to transition toward a communist mode of organization. POIP represents merely the first step in this direction—a challenging but hopeful endeavor!

### The POIP Contract for Public Ownership of Intellectual Property

POIP is based on blockchain technology, with its core implemented as a smart contract called the "Buyout Compensation Publicization Contract." This contract has undergone two iterations, from simple to more nuanced designs. Understanding the evolution of this contract offers a clear insight into the underlying principles of POIP. The iterations are as follows:

#### Buyout Cap Contract (Limited Buyout Contract)

Initially, the knowledge producer privately owns the intellectual property. They specify a maximum earnings cap (Max) and set a per-unit price for the product (Price). The number of required sales (Count) is then calculated as:

$$
Count = \frac{Max}{Price}
$$

The producer sells the product in the market. As sales progress and the actual number of sales approaches **Count**, the producer relinquishes their private ownership of the intellectual property, publicizing it for free use by everyone.

While the Buyout Cap Contract is simple and easy to implement, publicizing the intellectual property may lead to dissatisfaction among buyers, as they may prefer to wait until the product becomes free rather than paying upfront for access. To address this issue, several potential remedies can be implemented:

1. Issuing honors or recognition to early buyers.
2. Highlighting the time advantage for early buyers by delaying the publicization of the IP after reaching **Count**.
3. Adopting the following "Buyout Compensation Contract."

#### Buyout Compensation Contract

Initially, the knowledge producer privately owns the intellectual property. They specify a maximum earnings cap (Max) and set a per-unit price for the product (Price). The number of required sales (Count) is calculated as:

$$
Count = \frac{Max}{Price}
$$

The producer begins selling the product. As sales progress and the actual number of sales approaches **Count**, the producer does not immediately relinquish private ownership of the intellectual property. Subsequent purchasers of the product contribute their payments to a shared compensation pool, which is evenly redistributed to all previous buyers (including the new purchaser). Over time, the cost of accessing the product decreases for all buyers, approaching near-zero. At the same time, earlier buyers are fairly compensated, ensuring equitable payment for everyone. This effectively results in the practical publicization of the intellectual property.

To implement the redistribution of funds, the contract maintains the following records:

1. The balance of the contract account (separate from the producer's account, as this balance is used for compensating buyers; the producer cannot withdraw from it).
2. A list of buyers and the total number of buyers.
3. The amount of compensation already withdrawn by each buyer.
4. The maximum earnings cap (Max) and product price (Price).

When a new buyer purchases access to the product, they are added to the buyer list, increasing the total buyer count. The funds they contribute are added to the contract's account balance. When an existing buyer requests compensation, the contract calculates their compensation amount based on the formula:

$$
Amount = Price - \frac{Max}{BuyerCount}
$$

The contract determines the buyer's eligible compensation by subtracting the amount they have already withdrawn from the current eligible compensation. After processing the withdrawal, the buyer's total withdrawn amount is updated accordingly.

To lower the barrier for new buyers, the contract can allow for immediate compensation adjustment at the time of purchase. New buyers would only need to pay the difference between the per-unit price and their current eligible compensation to access the product. After completing the purchase, their total withdrawn compensation is updated to reflect the current eligible amount.

While the Buyout Compensation Contract ensures gradual publicization of usage rights, the ownership of the intellectual property formally remains private. To further promote the publicization of knowledge, a "Buyout Compensation Publicization Contract" can be adopted.

#### Buyout Compensation Publicization Contract (or Goal Max Contract)

Initially, the knowledge producer privately owns the intellectual property. They specify a maximum earnings cap (Max) and set a per-unit price for the product (Price). The required number of sales (Count) is calculated as:

$$
Count = \frac{Max}{Price}
$$

Additionally, the producer specifies a maximum compensation limit (**MaxCompensation**), which ideally approaches but does not exceed **Price**. As sales progress, buyers are added, and their compensation gradually increases. When the compensation for each buyer reaches **MaxCompensation**, the producer relinquishes ownership of the intellectual property, and the product becomes publicly owned.

The total number of buyers required to reach **MaxCompensation** can be calculated as:

$$
MaxBuyerCount = \frac{Max}{Price - MaxCompensation}
$$

By continuously tracking the total number of buyers, the contract ensures knowledge products are ultimately publicized when the total buyer count reaches **MaxBuyerCount**. 

This iterative framework bridges the gap between individual compensation and collective ownership, providing a practical pathway toward the publicization of knowledge.
